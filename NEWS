NEWS file for package RxpsG
Processing XPS and other experimental 
Giorgio Speranza & Roberto Canteri

##### Version RxpsG-2.0: all routines revisited, bugs corrected. New depthProfile option under testing

##### Version Rxps version 0.6.0
>> integrates the RxpsG using the sme name Rxps to avoid discrepancies between old and new analyzed data (graph settings)
>> integrates the Rxps0.5.5 with modified XPSprocessing.R, with additional functions for analysis, plot, annotate


##### Version 0.5.5
>> Add : XPSoverlayPlot now has the capability to switch from line to point and many combination of them.
>> Change: move the code 'plot' with mode="ov" into the XPSoverlayPlot function. Now 'plot' for XPSSample
	does only plot as panel.
>> New : XPSoverlayPlot function.

##### Version 0.5.3
>> Add: XPSGUI - require(tkrplot) + require(gWidgets2) + require(gWidgets2tcltk)
	This GUI include almost all manipulation for a XPSSample: baseline, components (add/delete and move), shift, display fit summary and quantification table.
>> Add: XPSexctractGUI - GUI for exctract a portion of a XPSCoreLine (typically "survey")
>> TODO: GUIs for exportASCII, RSF table, overlayPlot

##### Version 0.5.2
>> Change: transition package from rpanel to gWidgets2 packages

##### Version 0.5.1
>> Fix: XPSapplyshift now works as expected
>> Add: plot overlay now has alignment flag for core lines without baseline. 
>> Add: GUI for shift, addCoreLines and fit.

##### Version 0.5
>> Fix: plot for XPSSample did not overlay with vamas type.
>> Add: normalize intensity in plot for XPSSample 

##### Version 0.4.2
>> Add: quantification for Vamas files
>> Add: Access to reference file for Kratos instrument
>> Change: rewrite of all function to access the reference file for the two instruments (scienta, kratos)
>> Fixed : 'plot' for XPSCoreLine did not set the xlimit wider than range of x
>> Change: XPSquantify now print the sum of the concentration for each element
>> Change: Ycomponent and add it to fitComponent class
>> Change: lots of small fix to better code
##### Version 0.4.1
>> Change: small changes in XPSrecepies. Now they call the new XPSbaselineGUI interface
>> Add: Flags to manage RSF for Scienta and Kratos instruments.
>> New: XPSextract function to extract a portion from a core line trough GUI. 
>> New: XPSbaselineGUI function to add baseline with graphical interface.
>> Change: XPSbaseline does not plot anymore the results. Use the GUI version instead !!
>> Change: XPSquantify now has a variable to exclude any core line from quantification even if the baseline and/or fit are present
>> Fixed : shirley reverse when higher bgnd is at lower BE
>> Change: options for XPSremove are now lowercase and default option is "all"
>> Add   : XPSexportASCII to export data

##### Version 0.4
>> Fixed: bug in the XPSconstrain (and consequently in XPSfit) that it does not manage more than 1 link.
>> Add: to the definition of fitComponent the slot rsf. In this way any component has it's rsf.
>> Change : XPSsetRSF now sets the rsf only for the XPSCoreLine RSF slot and that is used in the case of quantification only trough the baseline definition.
>> Change: the XPSbaseline calls the XPSsetRSF and XPSaddFitComponent sets the rsf for each component.
>> Fix: many small "typo" mistakes.

##### Version 0.3
>> Add: the baseline slot has an item with the baseline class object in it
>> Change: now the baseline action is managed trough the 'baseline' package
>> Add: XPSresidualPlot function, mainly called after success with fit.
>> Add: readGenplot to manage RPL file for Genplot already processed files
>> Change: a lot of adjustments on the fit function definitions and start values. now everythings seems OK.
>> Add: XPSconstrain function does manage constrain
>> Add: avoid baseline add names to y coordinate
>> Add: function to manage param values into class fitComponent
>> Change: added a new class for fitComponent and change all code to include the new class
>> Change: the fit slot (@Fit) now has a $y item to be compatible with GENPLOT replot old files that have component but the fit is not exported.

##### Version 0.2
>> Change: the original data (Kinetic or Binding or Transmission or ... and Counts or Cps) are in the .Data slot but are transformed to Binding and cps for quantitative analysis. 
>> Change: the definition of XPSCoreLine


##### Version 0.1
Date: 2012-05-13
>> ## ADD: funzioni per cancellare Componenti, fit, baseline, regiontofit da linea di core e dal campione.
	
>> ## ADD: una funzione per creare una CoreLine dal survey ed includerla nel XPSsample. OK!

>> ## ADD: funzione che calcoli le y per le funzioni di fit e restituisca un dataframe o lista
	
>> ## ADD: assegnare una label (sequenza numerica oppure stringa) per le componenti di un fit OK!

##### Version: 0.0
Date: 2012-05-13
News: Start Release
>> Assembly of all functions already have.
